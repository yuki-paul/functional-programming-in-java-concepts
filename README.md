# Java Functional Programming Concepts

This Java code demonstrates various functional programming concepts using Java 8 features, including streams, functional interfaces, and lambda expressions.

## Overview

The `MainClass.java` file showcases different functional programming constructs like:
- **Imperative vs. Declarative approach**: Comparing traditional `for` loop with Stream API.
- **Functional Interfaces**:
  - `Function`: Examples with function chaining.
  - `Consumer` and `BiConsumer`: Usage in displaying and checking person details.
  - `Predicate`: Validation of email.
  - `Supplier`: Generating a dummy string.
- **Stream Operations**:
  - Filtering, mapping, and collecting data using `Stream` API.
  - Demonstrating various operations like `anyMatch`, `map`, `filter`, and `forEach`.
- **Miscellaneous**:
  - Mimicking a method type in JWT token code.
  - Using `extraSomething` method to extract data based on a resolver function.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy the `MainClass.java` content into your Java project.
2. Run the `MainClass` file to see the demonstration of functional programming concepts.

## Usage

This code serves as a practical demonstration of various functional programming concepts in Java. Feel free to explore and modify the code to understand these concepts better.
